# Legal OS React Code Exercise

Hi there! Thanks for doing our coding exercise. :). The exercise consists out of two parts:

1. Code the exercise
2. Answer questions in the [FOLLOW_UP.md](/FOLLOW_UP.md) document.

# Exercise

The exercise you will be doing today is to create a tiny single-page app:

## Requirements

There is only one use story:

* As a user I want to be able to pick a new color that Dirk will show he is feeling like. I also want to see Dirk express his new feeling. Dirk can only feel colors, not emotions.

### Design Requirements

Please see Figma designs for the design requirements:

When clicking on the link you will only see a static image. If you log in you will actually see the design requirements when hovering over the components.

### Technical Requirements

- Colors in the picker should be assigned at random at startup.
- The app needs to work on any PC screen in landscape mode.
  - Minimal resolution 1280 x 720
  - Maximal resolution 3840 x 2160
- Feel free to use any libraries you feel you need.
- Typescript is enabled in this repository but you are not obliged to use it.
- Both texts should be `h2` components.

## Getting Started

__Don't forget to run `npm install` before starting__
